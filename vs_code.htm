    <h2 class='ok'>Definition of vs code:</h2>
    <P>Visual Studio (VS) Code is an open-source code editor primarily used to correct and repair
        cloud and web applications coding errors. VS Code is developed by Microsoft and supports
        the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems. VS Code’s tools can be used to enhance
        the functionality of any written code. Based on the Electron framework, VS Code employs
        the same editor component used in Azure DevOps. By incorporating multiple FTP extensions,
        Users can sync code between the server and the editor without having to download extra
        software.

        FEATURES</h2>
    <li><I><b class="hii">Source control:</b></I> One of the core inbuilt features of VS Code is source control. A
        dedicated tab in the menu bar grants users access to the version control setting. In addition, users can view
        changes made on a running project. However, leveraging this source control option necessitates linking the VS
        code to requisite version control system</li>
    <li><i><b class="hii">Vast programming language:</b></i> The VS code supports numerous programming languages,
        including Python, C++, Go, JavaScript and Node.js. Aside from basic features like code folding, syntax
        highlighting and matching brackets. Other features may differ depending on the programming language. VS Code
        also offers IntelliSense for TypeScript, CSS, HTML, etc.</li>
    <li><i><b class="hii">IntelliSense Code completion:</b></i> Virtual Studio Code’s IntelliSense code completion can
        give programmers hints on the best possible function parameter, syntax, or variable. In addition, it can sense
        coding errors and offer suggestions to correct them</li>
    <li>Other features include Snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can customize the user experience by
        installing extensions extensions, using keyboard shortcuts, changing themes, and more.</li>
